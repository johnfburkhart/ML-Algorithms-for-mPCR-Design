# ML-Algorithms-for-mPCR-Design

This repository contains the work I did that was part of my work as a bioinformatics intern, and later as a member of the NAU machine learning lab. The goal of the project was to use machine learning algorithms to predict successful multiplex polyermase chain reaction (mPCR) trials. More abitiously, we hoped to use machine learning algorithms to enhance the designs of mPCR primers. 

As a sophmore, this was my first machine learning project, so you may notice some things that are strange. For example, I did all of my feature engineering and data analysis in Python, and then implemented machine learning algorithms (linear regression, random forests, extreme gradient boosting) in R. From what I know now, I would have either flipped this procedure around, or simply have done everything in Python. 

There are other strange things to be found in this projoject, but nothing too crazy. If you would like to know more about the results of this analysis, please feel free to reach out.
